# React For Beginners

## To Start
__First__ grab the [Create-react-app seed from github](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) or the [starter files from wesbos](https://github.com/wesbos/React-For-Beginners-Starter-Files)

- the create-react-app has already the webpack setup for your react app

-Here is the Documentation on how to get a react app running on the official [React site](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html).

-You also need to have installed __Node__ and __React Dev Tools__

__Second__ rename your starter file and run your react app

1. cd into `your-react-app`
2. run __npm install__ in your Terminal
 - this is going to read all the dependencies from your package.json file and install them

3. finally run __npm start__ to see your react app running in your browser
